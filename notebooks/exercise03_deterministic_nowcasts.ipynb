Calculate the nowcasts for 12 leadtimes, i.e. for 1 hour, and visualize some nowcasts with the observations. The semi-Lagrangian extrapolation method has some keyword arguments that can improve the quality of the nowcast depending on the data. For a full list of the arguments, see the [pySTEPS documentation](https://pysteps.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generated/pysteps.extrapolation.semilagrangian.extrapolate.html).\n",

    "As rainfall fields can grow and dissipate, a simple extrapolation nowcast probably does not provide sufficient predictability for rainfall forecasts up to a few hours into the future. A first step in this direction was the so-called S-PROG model, a deterministic predecessor of the popular STEPS model (more about that lateR), which makes use of decades of rainfall field research that points out that the lifetime of rainfall cells is related to the spatial extent of these rainfall cells. Hence, larger fields (e.g. stratiform rainfall) have a longer lifetime than smaller rainfall fields (e.g. thunderstorms). S-PROG distinguishes these scales with a Fast Fourier transform and filters out the smallest rainfall fields (with the shortest lifetimes) for increasing lead times. The advantage is that we only put emphasis on the rainfall fields that we can model relatively well, but the disadvantage is that we get a more smoothed rainfall forecast. The probabilistic follow up of this method, STEPS, uses stochastic perturbations to add new small scale rainfall fields to overcome this problem. More about that in the probabilistic nowcasting part. \n",
